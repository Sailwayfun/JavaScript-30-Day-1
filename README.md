# JavaScript-30-Day-1
Using React and Vite to develop a browser drum kit

# Acknowledgement
This prjoect is based on the JavaScript 30 program established by Wes Bos from the Syntaz project.


# Developer notes
Although the drum kit can absolutely be built by just Vanilla JavaScript, I try to use it as an oppurrtunity to practice breaking App down to separate component, 
and the use of CSS modules. There's also a little useEffect in the App.


#How to interact with the drums
Press keyboard keys with the corresponding key names, and you can hear the drum sounds, with a flashy animation of 500 ms.
